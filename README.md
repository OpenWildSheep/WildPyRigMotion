# WildPyRigMotion

WildPyRigMotion provides a Python binding for RigLogic. It is designed to be used in python softwares like **Blender**.

## üìñ Overview

[**RigLogic**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Plugins/RigLogicLib/riglogic) is part of [**Unreal Engine**](https://www.unrealengine.com) and [**MetaHuman**](https://www.unrealengine.com/fr/metahuman). It is used to manage advanced character rigs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

WildPyRigMotion does not contain or redistribute the RigLogic source code or binaries.  
RigLogic is proprietary technology developed by Epic Games as part of Unreal Engine and MetaHuman.  
To use WildPyRigMotion, you must already have a valid installation of Unreal Engine with the "3Lateral RigLogic Plugin for Facial Animation" provided by Epic Games, under Epic's own license terms.  

This project is an independent open-source binding.  
It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Epic Games.

## üöÄ Installation

### üìå Requirements

-   **Unreal Engine** (Source code required)
-   **CMake** (Version 3.13+ recommended)
-   **Python** (Version 3.7+ recommended)

### üõ†Ô∏è Compilation
    
Run the following commands, replacing `path/to/UnrealEngine` and `path/to/python` with your actual paths:
    
```sh
cmake -B build -DRIGLOGIC_SOURCE_DIR="path/to/UnrealEngine/Engine/Plugins/Animation/RigLogic/Source/RigLogicLib" -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE="path/to/python/python.exe"
cmake --build build --config Release
```    

‚ö†Ô∏è If you plan to use RigLogic in Blender, ensure to use the same python version than your Blender.

## üìö Usage

Once WildPyRigMotion is installed, here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from pydna import BinaryStreamReader, FileStream, DataLayer

stream = FileStream("Ada.dna", FileStream.AccessMode.Read, FileStream.OpenMode.Binary)
reader = BinaryStreamReader(stream, DataLayer.All)
reader.read()

from pyriglogic import RigInstance, RigLogic

rig_logic = RigLogic(reader)
rig_instance = RigInstance(rig_logic)

expressions = ["browDown", "browLateral"]

rig_instance.setLOD(0)

for expression_name in expressions:
    for raw_control_index in range(reader.getRawControlCount()):
        control_name = reader.getRawControlName(raw_control_index)
        if expression_name in control_name.split(".")[-1]:
            rig_instance.setRawControl(raw_control_index, 1.0)

rig_logic.calculate(rig_instance)
joint_value = rig_instance.getJointOutputs()
 
```
